# scrapegoat
### _THIS CODE IS FOR LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE ACTUALLY APPLIED_
ScrapeGoat is a code I've written from scratch to access a specific website and scrape for articles about certain tickers.

# Getting started
To use ScrapeGoat, tickers.csv is a csv file that contains the ticker names for all desired companies. You will also need an account email and password to access the site that was scraped.

# Potential issues
  Running scrapegoat might take a while, depending on the number of articles and tickers being checked. 
  You can speed it up by adjusting the values on the time variables, but note that this might impact the
  performance of your code and it's accuracy.
  
  If while running, the browser crashes, follow instructions in code to uncomment/comment certain lines out.
  
  
# Edits
  Please edit the desired path, email, and password for your purposes before running.
